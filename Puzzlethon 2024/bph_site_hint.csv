You are on the right track though! It is possible to view a Grassmannian as an affine algebraic variety, under which you can look at the Zariski closure of subsets of it.

As you say, the letters in the eye exam map to specific squares on the dartboard. The squares in the dartboard that the letters map to are laid out similarly to how they are laid out in the eye exam; and the colorings match up. (So, the E goes on the bullseye, which is red with a green rim; then the next row goes onto white cells only; then the next cell goes onto black cells only; then the next row goes onto thin red and green rectangles.) There's only one way to lay out the letters such that E is at the top, all the letters are laid out correctly relative to each other, and the colors match correctly.

Jack of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs, 4 of Clubs, Queen of Hearts -> I'm assuming that these will remain as the flop for the entire puzzle.

I'm not sure if I'm understanding the game correctly but I think the 2 cards in your possession are combined with any 3 from the flop to form a hand. These hands then have names and rank higher than others. 

E.g. 
in round 1 I have that their hand would be leading towards a high card (either King of Diamonds / Ace of clubs if that counts as it is in the flop) and my hand would be the same (6 Hearts / Ace of clubs for same reason)

In round 2 I have that their hand would be leading to a two pair and my hand being another high card (5 Hearts / Ace of clubs for same reasoning above).

I'm using the list of hands available at https://www.pokernews.com/poker-hands.htm

For this meta, we got answers to 8 out of 10 feeders ('staze' has not been unlocked yet, and 'Choreography' is described as 'much, much harder than the rest of the hunt')

Based on our understanding of FT, we tried to draw two paths. It seems that the loactions of some of the feeder puzzles are not passed through on the map. We guess that we need to fill the feeders answers into the grid to satisfy the same number corresponding to the same letter (the same is true for the common grids passed by two paths), and finally get 10 letters of answers.

Is our thinking correct? Please give us some hints. Thank you very much!!!

Regarding the feeder for this question, based on the length of the words, we can easily determine that the first two are ""PARARAPHICALLY"" and ""CENTRALEX ECUTIVECOMMITTEEOFTESOVIETIUNION"" (which also have very similar forms to guess from shaded texts), but we have not been able to determine what the remaining feeders are (the unresolved ""bloodsucker"" should be related to Braille, but the answer length seems to be 12).
At the same time, we noticed that the clarity of the overall images in the question has become increasingly high, and we speculate that this may be related to time (or the number of related feeders solved). Based on the topic of the puzzle, we speculate that we should calculate the score of the letters in brackets on the eye exam chart.

-Most shaving cream pies thrown into another person's face with the head facing backwards in 30 seconds is 9 and was achieved by Kidu Mearg (Ethiopia), on the set of Lo Show Dei Record in Milan, Italy, on 18 February 2022.
-The most nails hammered using the back of the hands in 30 seconds is 8 and was achieved by Chirag Lukha (UK) in Leicester, Leicestershire, UK, on 16 November 2023.
-The fewest charge stops to cross New Zealand in an electric car is 6, achieved by John Fitness (New Zealand), from 4 to 5 February 2021.
-The most rotating puzzle cubes solved one-handed underwater is 8, and was achieved by Daryl Tan Hong An (Singapore) in Singapore, on 18 April 2021.
-The most hats thrown onto a hat stand in 30 seconds is 13, and was achieved by Ashrita Furman (USA) in Jamaica, New York, USA, on 24 November 2017.
-The two species of great penguin – namely, the emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri of Antarctica and the king penguin A. patagonicus of southernmost South America and several northern subantarctic islands – each lay only a single egg per year. All other species lay two. However, the great penguins' eggs are large with thick shells for protection purposes. In the emperor penguin, 15.7% of the egg's total weight is its shell, which helps very considerably to minimise breakage of what, as a single egg per penguin couple per year, is a precious commodity for its species' survival.
-The fewest fights to become a four-belt undisputed world boxing champion is 9, achieved by Claressa Shields (USA) from 19 November 2016 to 13 April 2019.
Neil Rackers (USA) of the Arizona Cardinals established an NFL record by kicking at least two field goals in 11 consecutive games, during the 2005 season.

White Pawn - 1 - 2 - 'Objections' - 4 - 5 - 2 - 6 - 'Incomplete Instrumentation' - 3 - Mushroom

Black Pawn - 8 - 7 - '數學題目' - 2 - 3- 9 - 'Prefix' - 4 - 'Previous Commute' - 10 - 'Flag Code' - 5 - Mushroom

On the plus side, these paths hit all the numbers in the grid, which makes them seem correct. However they don't hit all the given feeders. In fact it doesn't seem possible to hit, for example, 'Spindle Choreography' without back-tracking, which wouldn't be a normal maze path.

Assuming these paths are correct. Stuck on what's next. The numbers 1-10 (with 2 appearing twice) suggest a 10 letter answer with letters somehow plucked from the feeders that are traversed. (The numbers can't be indexing into feeders as none of the answers has more than 6 letters.)

In terms of what to do with the numbers 1-10, check out the puzzle page again looking for an ordered list of 10 things. Check out the feeders again, especially with respect to the title of this puzzle, and see if you can find any ways to apply that same mechanic to fill in the numbered paths with letters.

We are unsure of how to apply the different feeder answers. The answers are too long for the corridors to simply place them from their puzzle's position, so we don't know how to use them. We believe that each number will correspond to a single letter, which we will extract to the answer, but don't know how to associate each number with a letter.

The spreadsheet where we have found the paths and our current list of feeders is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G_p4oH1cW4Ggq__qJR-0YN8KIia0KrjjYHPevhxdo6Q/edit?gid=1043086636#gid=1043086636","2024-11-30 03:44:47.727+00","fee3c434-034b-4f1d-8da0-c3a686c74cec","2024-11-30 03:55:37.522+00","Nice work!
For associating each feeder with a number, note the list of 10 puzzles at the bottom of the puzzle page; that is the numbering for the feeders. (So the first feeder is 1, the second is 2, and so on.)
As for getting a letter for each feeder, there is a certain transformation that can be done for every feeder, as clued by the title.

"110","alice","f7792d64-abcc-4c64-9e89-2335553cc459","Based on the puzzle name and FT (poker flop turn), we believe that this question should be about Hold'em, and we may need to speculate on the remaining card to obtain the answer. We believe its four feeders are
HECTOR
CLOVER
DEVILSBEDPOST
HELENOFTROY
These feeders all have an initial letter representing the color (H C D H), but how should we determine their numbers?
Based on the consideration of non repetition, we believe that, for example, HECTOR should not be one of  heart A24569, but we have no other clues.

Do the colors in the eye exam remind you of anything? (Not a Snellen chart... something else!) There is also some cluing in the flavortext which might help you identify what game is being played here.
Adding letter scores is the right idea. The numbers you're getting will make more sense once you know what you're looking at.
